# Getting Started

## Overview
This application is designed to help you shorten long URLs, making them easier to share and manage.
But that’s not all – our API also provides powerful analytics to track the performance of your shortened 
links.

## Important Note
This API is not intended to be exposed directly to clients. It should be kept hidden behind a
node server, such as one built with **Next.js**. Because of this design, some implementation details
are omitted from this documentation.

## Features
- <u>Link Shortening:</u> Effortlessly convert lengthy URLs into short, manageable links that are easy to share across various platforms.
- <u>Analytics:</u> Gain insights into how your links are performing with detailed analytics. Track metrics such as devices, os system, unique views and etc.
